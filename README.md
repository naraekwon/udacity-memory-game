## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

For details, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## How to Run

Open index.html file on your preferred web browser.

## How to Play

When a player opens the file on your preferred web browser, the timer will start automatically. You can flip two cards for each move. If the flipped cards match, they will remain open. When they don't match, they will flip again. The player will lose a star rate after every eight moves. The player can restart the game by clicking the restarting button at the top right hand corner.
